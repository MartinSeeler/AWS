## Doc
* [AWS Secrets Manager Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)

## Intro
* AWS Secrets Manager helps you to securely encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials
  for your databases and other services. Instead of hardcoding credentials in your
  apps, you can make calls to Secrets Manager to retrieve your credentials whenever
  needed. Secrets Manager helps you protect access to your IT resources and data by
  enabling you to rotate and manage access to your secrets. 
  
## Power Point
* Code has to call an API using an API key
* How do we generally code it
* import creds (bad idea)
