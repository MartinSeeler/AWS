## Intro
* Query Data in S3 using SQL
* Amazon Athena is an interactive **query* service that makes it easy to analyze data
  in Amazon **S3** using standard **SQL**. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure
  to setup or manage, and you pay only for the queries you run. To get started,
  simply point to your data in S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL. 

## AWS Console
