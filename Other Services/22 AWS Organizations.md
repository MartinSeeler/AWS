## Intro
* AWS Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate
  **multiple AWS accounts into an organization** that you create and centrally manage.
  With AWS Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts
  to join your organization. You can organize those accounts and manage them as a group.
