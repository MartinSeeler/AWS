# Amazon API Gateway

## Intro
* Amazon API Gateway helps developers to create and manage APIs
  to back-end systems running on Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, or any
  publicly addressable web service. With Amazon API Gateway,
  you can generate custom client SDKs for your APIs, to connect
  your back-end systems to mobile, web, and server applications or services.
