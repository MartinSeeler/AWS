# Registered domains

## Doc

## Acronym

## Cons
* if you delete your hosted zone (ex. domain1.com) of own registered domain (buy from AWS) - it's not very quick to rebuild for new IP/LB, for hosted zone

* hosted zones:
* 172800 (TTL) / 60 = 2880 min = 48 h = **2 j**
* we pay each item record in a hosted zone
* idem if we try with alias (A) - nothing
