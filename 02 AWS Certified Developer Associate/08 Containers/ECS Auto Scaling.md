# ECS Auto Scaling

## Doc

## Acronym
* ECS - Elastic Container service
* ASG - Auto-Scaling Group

## Intro
* CPU & RAM is tracked in CloudWatch at the ECS service level
* **Target Tracking**: target a specific average CloudWatch metric
* **Step Scaling**: scale based on CloudWatch alarms
* **Scheduled Scaling**: based on predictable changes
* ECS service scaling (task level) â‰  EC2 auto scaling (instance level)
* Fargate auto scaling is much easier to setup (because serverless)

## ECS - Cluster Capacity Provider
* A capacity provider is used in association with a cluster to determine the infrastructure that a task runs on
    * For ECS & Fargate users, the Fargate & FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers are added automatically
    * For Amazon ECS on EC2, you need to associate the capacity provider with an auto-scaling group
* When yu run a task or a service, you define a capacity provider strategy, to prioritize in which provider to run
* This allows the capacity provider to automatically provision infrastructure for you
