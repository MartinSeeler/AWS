# CLI Installation Troubleshooting

## Intro
* If after installing the AWS CLI, you use it & you get the error
    * **aws: command not found**
    * Then, on Linux, Mac & Windows
      * the aws executable is not in the **path environment variable**
* PATH allows your system to know where to find the "aws" executable
