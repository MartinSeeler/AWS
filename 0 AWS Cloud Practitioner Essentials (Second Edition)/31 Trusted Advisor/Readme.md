## Intro 
* AWS Trusted Advisor is an online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance,
  and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment. AWS Trusted Advisor provides
  real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
  To help you maximize utilization of Reserved Instances, AWS Trusted Advisor checks your
  Amazon EC2 computing-consumption history and calculates an optimal number of Partial Upfront
  Reserved Instances. Recommendations are based on the previous calendar month's hour-by-hour
  usage aggregated across all consolidated billing accounts. Note that Trusted Advisor does
  not provide size-flexible Reserved Instance recommendations.
